# Sugarcane Production Analysis 🌱

This project analyzes global sugarcane production data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.  
Using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and created visualizations to better understand production across countries and continents.

## ✨ Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw agricultural production data
- Converted messy string/object columns into usable numeric formats
- Analyzed production and acreage at both **country** and **continent** levels
- Built correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables
- Visualized distributions, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps
- Grouped data by continent to compare large-scale production patterns

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📌 Key Insights
  - Asia leads global sugarcane production by a large margin
  - Acreage and production are highly correlated across most countries
  - Some countries achieve higher yield despite smaller acreage

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sugarcane-production.git
